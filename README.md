## How to run locally ?

Just git clone the repo in your local machine
Then open the terminal in the project's root folder and type this command- 

` npm i `

Then to run the deployment server type this- 

` npm run dev `

Now open the project and create a new branch so that your code is isolated from the main code for example your branch name is face-feature then you write -

` git checkout -b face-feature `

After you have finished coding just push and try not to commit any merge conflicts .

## How to run locally ?

Just git clone the repo in your local machine
Then open the terminal in the project's root folder and type this command- 

` npm i `

Then to run the deployment server type this- 

` npm run dev `

Now open the project and create a new branch so that your code is isolated from the main code for example your branch name is face-feature then you write -

` git checkout -b face-feature `

After you have finished coding just push and try not to commit any merge conflicts .

## How to structure the code - 

I have created a folder in src called pages. If you are working on lets say about then create a file About.jsx and work on that . Import all the components in this file only no mattert how many components you make.
Add all the compontents in the components folder by creating a new subfolder in it called about (same as the page you are creating so there wont be mess of different components )
